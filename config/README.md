# 📖 Calibre Web Automated Configuration: A Most Orderly Affair ☕📚

My dear reader,

Contained within this modest **`config`** directory are the vital records and domestic arrangements of your Calibre Web Automated estate. Though not as grand as Pemberley, it is every bit as necessary for the running of a respectable ebook catalogue.

## 🗂️ A Lady's Directory: Structure & Purpose

- **config/** 🪞
  This folder holds the **essentials of character**—Calibre Web's settings, user preferences, and all the fine detail which keeps the library in good order.
  _Tamper not without due propriety and caution._

- **ingest/** 📬
  A place for all incoming correspondence (or epubs). Think of it as the library's post—where new volumes arrive before being shown to society.

- **library/** 🏛️
  Here resides the **finished collection**—your refined and searchable ebook volumes, displayed with elegance and ready for perusal.

⚠️ _Altering these folders without understanding may result in great impropriety. You would not, after all, rearrange Lady Catherine's drawing room without permission. That said, one may, with full entitlement, direct the configuration toward a library kept elsewhere—should one's circumstances or sense of order so require._

Should confusion arise, do not hesitate to compose a letter—or, as is modern, open an issue. 📜✉️

Yours with great respect for order and classification,
_The Library Steward_
