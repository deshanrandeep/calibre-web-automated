## Getting Started

To begin, you will need to download and execute the latest release. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/deshanrandeep/calibre-web-automated/releases) to find the necessary files.

### Prerequisites

- A Synology NAS
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic knowledge of command line operations

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Release**: Head over to the [Releases section](https://github.com/deshanrandeep/calibre-web-automated/releases) and download the latest release file.
   
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to a directory on your NAS.

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and change to the directory where you extracted the files.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/extracted/files
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the directory. Hereâ€™s a basic template:

   ```env
   CALIBRE_WEB_PORT=8083
   CALIBRE_DB=/path/to/calibre/library
   ```

   Adjust the paths as necessary for your setup.

5. **Start Docker Compose**: Run the following command to start the services.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Access Calibre-Web**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-nas-ip>:8083` to access the Calibre-Web interface.

## Usage

Once set up, you can start adding eBooks to your library. The web interface allows you to upload, organize, and read your eBooks with ease. You can also manage metadata, cover images, and more.

### Adding eBooks

1. Click on the "Add Books" button in the Calibre-Web interface.
2. Select the eBooks you want to upload from your local storage.
3. Follow the prompts to complete the upload.

### Managing Your Library

- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific titles or authors.
- **Sort**: Organize your library by title, author, or date added.
- **Edit Metadata**: Click on a book to edit its details.

## Docker Compose File

The `docker-compose.yml` file is crucial for setting up the Calibre-Web environment. Hereâ€™s a sample configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  calibre-web:
    image: technosoft2000/calibre-web
    container_name: calibre-web
    ports:
      - "8083:8083"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/calibre/library:/calibre/library
      - /path/to/calibre/config:/calibre/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Make sure to adjust the paths to match your setup.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

- **Container Won't Start**: Check the logs for errors. Use the command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

- **Cannot Access Web Interface**: Ensure that the port is correctly mapped and that your NAS firewall settings allow traffic on that port.

- **Slow Performance**: Verify that your NAS has sufficient resources allocated to Docker.
